## AI and Conversational Integration

Integrate AI models with conversational interfaces to create responsive systems. You start by selecting frameworks like TensorFlow for AI and Dialogflow for chatbots.

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
  // Integrate AI model with chatbot
  import { OpenAI } from 'openai';
  const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY' });

  async function generateResponse(userInput) {
    const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: userInput }],
    });
    return completion.choices[0].message.content;
  }
  ```
  ```python
  # Python AI integration example
  import openai

  openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

  def generate_response(user_input):
      response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
          model='gpt-3.5-turbo',
          messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': user_input}]
      )
      return response.choices[0].message.content
  ```
